# Architectural Decisions

## Why Microservices?
Chosen to practice service isolation, scalability, and real-world distributed system challenges.

## Why Node.js?
Fast iteration, strong ecosystem, and wide industry adoption.

## Why Kafka?
To implement asynchronous event-driven communication and decouple services.

## Trade-offs
- Increased complexity compared to monolith
- Higher operational overhead
- Better scalability and service ownership
