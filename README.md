# microservices-project

A production-grade learning project designed to practice real-world
microservices architecture, event-driven systems, and full-stack development.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Design and build microservices end-to-end
- Combine synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (Kafka) communication
- Implement authentication and authorization flows
- Build a scalable frontend consuming multiple services
- Apply real-world architectural patterns

---

## 🧠 Why This Project
This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to gain practical
experience with:

- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven systems (Kafka)
- Dockerized services
- API Gateway patterns
- Frontend state management and UX flows
- Observability and scalability

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
- Microservices-based architecture
- API Gateway as a single entry point
- REST + Event-driven communication
- Database per service
- Dockerized local development
- Frontend (React + TypeScript)

---

## 🧩 Implemented Phases

### ✅ Phase 0 – Product Definition & Architecture
- System design
- Service boundaries
- Documentation and diagrams

### ✅ Phase 1–7 – Backend & Infrastructure
- Auth service
- User service
- Task service
- API Gateway
- Kafka integration
- Analytics & Redis
- Docker setup

### ✅ Phase 8 – Frontend
- Auth flow (login / register / refresh)
- Tasks CRUD
- UX-safe async handling
- Clear loading, empty, and error states
- UI polish and visual consistency

---

## 🚧 Future Work
- Advanced task features (filters, grouping)
- UI design system and modern styling
- Production hardening
- Monitoring and alerting
